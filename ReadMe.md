# Getting Lookup Data Into You View ASP.net MVC 6 Version

In my [blog post Getting Lookup Data Into You View ASP.net MVC 6 Version](https://blog.simontimms.com/2015/06/09/getting-lookup-data-into-you-view/) 
i explain how dependency injection can be used to populate Dropdowns in a view. The benefit is that that view code does not have to take care to retrieve the look up data and 
the service that provides the look up data can be easily used in multiple views.
